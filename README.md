# Summary
We designed a dynamic programming algorithm to produce profit maximizing schedules for a power generator subject to various physical constraints. 

We found that implementing a dynamic programming approach produced efficient results for a range of constraint values and schedule durations. While this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality, adding dynamic programming leaves a relatively simple approach to adding new constraints that produce a more realistic schedule. 

Thus, the algorithm we have developed appears to be tractable as a fast, heuristic solution to the one generator power generator scheduling problem that is relatively easy to implement and modify based on the exact physical constraints of the generators.
